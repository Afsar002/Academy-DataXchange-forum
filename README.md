# InfoExchangeDApp

**InfoExchangeDApp** is a decentralized application that enables secure and seamless exchange of information for Ether on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform empowers users to monetize their data and access valuable information through transparent and trustless transactions.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a decentralized marketplace where information can be traded securely and efficiently, allowing individuals to unlock the value of their knowledge while ensuring data integrity and privacy.

## Flowchart

### Overview of Process Flow:

1. **Seller**:
   - Adds information to the platform, setting a price in Ether.
   - Information is stored on the blockchain, along with the seller's address and the price.

2. **Buyer**:
   - Selects information to purchase and sends the required amount of Ether to the contract.
   - The contract automatically transfers the Ether to the seller upon successful purchase.
   - Buyer can retrieve the purchased information.

3. **Contract**:
   - Manages listings, transactions, and data retrieval.
   - Ensures that only paid information is accessible to buyers.

## Smart Contract

- **Contract Address**: `0xc81644414ea1f27119b871b09ee9176a7365767a`
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54936668-0daf-4fb5-8d10-301f73dee622)

- **Network**: Deployed on the Ethereum Rinkeby Testnet

### Key Functions:

- `addInformation(string memory _data, uint _price)`: List information for sale.
- `purchaseInformation(uint _infoId)`: Buy listed information by sending Ether.
- `getInformation(uint _infoId)`: Retrieve the purchased information.

## Future Scope

- **Expansion to Mainnet**: Deploy the contract on the Ethereum Mainnet for broader adoption.
- **Enhanced Security**: Implement encryption for stored information to enhance data privacy.
- **Reputation System**: Introduce a reputation system to rate sellers based on the quality of information.
- **Integration with IPFS**: Store large data off-chain using IPFS, ensuring decentralization and scalability.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Enable payment with multiple cryptocurrencies beyond Ether.
