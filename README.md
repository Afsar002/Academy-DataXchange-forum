# InfoExchangeDApp

**InfoExchangeDApp** is a decentralized application that enables secure and seamless exchange of information for Ether on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform empowers users to monetize their data and access valuable information through transparent and trustless transactions.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a decentralized marketplace where information can be traded securely and efficiently, allowing individuals to unlock the value of their knowledge while ensuring data integrity and privacy.

## Flowchart

### Overview of Process Flow:

1. **Seller**:
   - Adds information to the platform, setting a price in Ether.
   - Information is stored on the blockchain, along with the seller's address and the price.

2. **Buyer**:
   - Selects information to purchase and sends the required amount of Ether to the contract.
   - The contract automatically transfers the Ether to the seller upon successful purchase.
   - Buyer can retrieve the purchased information.

3. **Contract**:
   - Manages listings, transactions, and data retrieval.
   - Ensures that only paid information is accessible to buyers.

(You can include a simple flowchart image in your repository to visually represent this process.)
